# .gitignore

`.gitignore` is a special file in a Git repository that tells Git which files and directories to ignore when committing changes. This is useful because there are often files or directories in a project that do not need to be tracked by Git, such as logs, and temporary files. By ignoring these files, you can keep your repository clean and avoid cluttering it with unnecessary files.
